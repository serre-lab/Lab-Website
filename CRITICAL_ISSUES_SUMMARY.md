## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE: officialPublicationUrls.js Contains Duplicate/Wrong URLs

**File:** `/Users/tserre/Projects/Lab-Website/src/data/officialPublicationUrls.js`

### The Problem
Six different 2016 publications are ALL mapped to the SAME Nature Communications article (ncomms13928):

```javascript
"2016_Mely_VR": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928",
"2016_Mely_CCNV": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928",
"2016_Pascarella_JNM-1": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928",
"2016_Cauchoix_NI": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928",
"serre2016": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928",
"75760312": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928",
```

This is clearly incorrect. These are different papers that should link to different articles:
- 2016_Mely_VR ‚Üí Vision Research paper on boundary detection
- 2016_Mely_CCNV ‚Üí Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience chapter
- 2016_Pascarella_JNM-1 ‚Üí Journal of Neuroscience Methods paper
- 2016_Cauchoix_NI ‚Üí Neuroimage paper on visual categorization
- serre2016 ‚Üí Wiley review article
- 75760312 ‚Üí ECCV 2012 color descriptor paper

**Action Required:** Remove or correct these entries immediately. They will cause the wrong URLs to appear on the website.

### 4. Papers Using Remote PDFs (53 papers)

All papers from 2000-2014 use remote URLs pointing to:
- `http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/wp-content/uploads/...`

**Risk:** If the old server goes down, all these PDFs become unavailable.

**Recommendation:** Download and host locally for reliability.
