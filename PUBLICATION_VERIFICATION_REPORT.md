### 4. Papers with Remote PDF URLs (53 papers)

These papers link to PDFs on the old serre-lab.clps.brown.edu server instead of local copies:

#### Breakdown by Year:
- **2000-2006:** All papers (7 total)
- **2007:** 5 papers
- **2009-2014:** 18 papers
- **2016-2019:** 20 papers
- **2021-2022:** 2 papers

**Recommendation:** These should ideally be downloaded and hosted locally for reliability.

## Suspicious Entries in officialPublicationUrls.js

The following entries in the override file appear suspicious or potentially incorrect:

1. **Lines 39-46:** Multiple 2016 papers all mapped to the same Nature Communications URL (ncomms13928):
   - "2016_Mely_VR"
   - "2016_Mely_CCNV"
   - "2016_Pascarella_JNM-1"
   - "2016_Cauchoix_NI"
   - "serre2016"
   - "75760312"

   This is clearly wrong - different papers shouldn't link to the same article.

2. **Lines 54-67:** Placeholders with incomplete URLs (missing DOI/article IDs):
   - "Cauchoix_etal_NIPS20122"
   - "paper_cameraReady-2"
   - "Serre-encyclopedia_revised"
   - "2013_Tan_NIPS"
   - "Leussis_Ank3_BiolPsych2012"
   - etc.

3. **Systematic Issues:**
   - Many entries use PDF filenames instead of publication titles
   - URLs contain placeholder text instead of actual DOIs
   - Several entries reference MIT CSAIL technical reports with incomplete handles

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix arXiv URLs (15 papers):** Replace arXiv links with official conference/journal URLs for published papers
2. **Fix officialPublicationUrls.js:** Remove or correct the suspicious duplicate/placeholder entries
3. **Add missing URLs (52 papers):** Particularly for high-impact journals and recent papers (2010-2022)

### Medium Priority
4. **Add missing PDFs (47 papers):** Especially for 2022-2024 papers and high-impact journals
5. **Download remote PDFs (53 papers):** Migrate from serre-lab.clps.brown.edu to local hosting

### Low Priority
6. **Verify all URLs:** Ensure all official URLs are correct and working
7. **Standardize PDF naming:** Ensure consistency in pdfPath format

## Data Files Analyzed

1. `/Users/tserre/Projects/Lab-Website/src/data/publications_by_year.json` - Main publication database
2. `/Users/tserre/Projects/Lab-Website/src/data/officialPublicationUrls.js` - URL overrides (contains errors)
3. `/Users/tserre/Projects/Lab-Website/public/papers/` - Local PDF directory (84 files)

---

## Next Steps

To fix the identified issues, you should:

1. Create a spreadsheet or database to track the 15 papers that need arXivâ†’official URL updates
2. Clean up or remove the officialPublicationUrls.js file's duplicate/placeholder entries
3. Systematically add missing official URLs for the 52 papers without any URL
4. Obtain and add PDFs for the 47 papers missing them, prioritizing high-impact journals
5. Consider downloading the 53 remote PDFs to local storage for long-term reliability
