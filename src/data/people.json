            "description": "Dr. Serre is a Professor in Cognitive Linguistic & Psychological Sciences and in Computer Science, and an affiliate of the Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown University. He received a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from MIT in 2006 and an MSc in EECS from Télécom Bretagne (France) in 2000. His research seeks to understand the neural computations supporting visual perception and has been featured in the BBC series “Visions from the Future” and other news articles (The Economist, New Scientist, Scientific American, IEEE Computing in Science and Technology, Technology Review and Slashdot). Dr. Serre is Faculty Director of the Center for Computation and Visualization and Associate Director of the Center for Computational Brain Science at Brown University. He also holds an International Chair in AI within the ANR-3IA Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (France). Dr. Serre is routinely serving as an area chair for top-tier machine learning and computer vision conferences including AAAI, CVPR, ICLR, ICML and NeurIPS. He was the recipient of an NSF Early Career Award as well as DARPA’s Young Faculty Award and Director’s Award."
