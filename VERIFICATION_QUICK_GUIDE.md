## üö® Most Critical Issues

### 1. officialPublicationUrls.js Bug
**File:** `/Users/tserre/Projects/Lab-Website/src/data/officialPublicationUrls.js`
**Lines:** 39-52

Six different papers incorrectly mapped to same URL:
```
"2016_Mely_VR": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928",
"2016_Mely_CCNV": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928",
... (4 more)
```

**Fix:** Remove or correct these entries

### 2. arXiv URLs for Published Papers (15 papers)
These papers are published at NeurIPS/ICLR/CVPR/ICML but link to arXiv.

**Years affected:** 2014, 2018, 2020-2024

**Fix:** Update `url` field in publications_by_year.json to official proceedings

### 3. Missing High-Impact PDFs (5 papers)
- Science Advances (2021)
- Nature Neuroscience (2018)
- Brain (2023)
- Neuropsychopharmacology (2018)
- eNeuro (2020)

**Fix:** Download and add to `/public/papers/`

## üìã Top Priority Tasks

### Task 1: Fix officialPublicationUrls.js (5 min)
```bash

## üéØ Goal

Get from **16% complete** (URL + local PDF) to **100% complete** for all 126 publications.

## üìä Progress Tracking

Use the CSV file to track your progress:
```bash
cd /Users/tserre/Projects/Lab-Website
open publication_issues_detailed.csv
```

Filter by "Issue Type" to work on specific categories.

## üîç Validation

After making changes, run this to verify:
```bash
# Count papers with URLs
grep -c '"url":' src/data/publications_by_year.json

# Count papers with pdfPath
grep -c '"pdfPath":' src/data/publications_by_year.json

# Count local PDFs
ls public/papers/*.pdf | wc -l
```
