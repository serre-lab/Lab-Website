# Width Standardization Summary

**Date:** October 4, 2025

## Overview

Standardized all page content widths to match the Publications page (800px max-width) for consistent layout and better readability across the entire website.

---

## Problem

Different pages had different content widths:
- **Publications page:** 800px ✓
- **Home page:** 1100px (wider than publications)
- **People page:** 1200px (widest)
- **Research page:** 1100px
- **Resources page:** 1100px
- **App root:** 1280px

This created an inconsistent experience where boxes and text looked wider on some pages than others.

---

## Solution

Changed all page containers to use consistent **800px max-width**:

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/src/App.css`
```css
#root {
    /* max-width controlled by individual page containers (800px) */
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 0;
    text-align: center;
}
```
- Removed 1280px max-width
- Individual pages now control their own width

#### 2. `/src/pages/Home/Home.css`
**Changed:**
- `.home-content`: 1100px → **800px**
- `.funding-description`: 1100px → **800px**
- `.featured-projects-section`: 1100px → **800px**
- `.recent-highlights-section`: 1100px → **800px**

#### 3. `/src/pages/People/People.css`
**Changed:**
- `.people-container`: 1200px → **800px**
- `.alumni-list`: 1100px → **800px**

#### 4. `/src/pages/Research/Research.css`
**Changed:**
- `.research-container`: 1100px → **800px**
- `.research-description`: 1100px → **800px**
- `.research-direction-card`: 1100px → **800px**

#### 5. `/src/pages/Resources/Resources.css`
**Changed:**
- `.resources-container`: 1100px → **800px**

#### 6. `/src/pages/Publications/Publications.css`
**No changes needed** - Already at 800px ✓

## Benefits

### 1. Visual Consistency
- All pages now have the same content width
- Text and cards align consistently across pages
- Better visual flow when navigating between pages

### 2. Improved Readability
- 800px is optimal for reading text (60-75 characters per line)
- Prevents text from becoming too wide on large screens
- Matches established best practices for content width

### 3. Unified Design
- Single standard width makes the site feel more cohesive
- Easier to maintain in the future
- Simpler to add new pages (just use 800px)

## Before vs After

### Before
```
Publications:  [========800px========]
Home:          [==========1100px==========]
People:        [===========1200px===========]
Research:      [==========1100px==========]
Resources:     [==========1100px==========]
```

### After
```
Publications:  [========800px========]
Home:          [========800px========]
People:        [========800px========]
Research:      [========800px========]
Resources:     [========800px========]
```

## Responsive Behavior

All pages maintain their responsive breakpoints:
- **Desktop (>1024px):** 800px max-width
- **Tablet (768-1024px):** Full width with padding
- **Mobile (<768px):** Full width with reduced padding

The standardization only affects desktop/large screen layouts.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Home page content is narrower (matches Publications width)
- [ ] People page content is narrower (matches Publications width)
- [ ] Research page content is narrower (matches Publications width)
- [ ] Resources page content is narrower (matches Publications width)
- [ ] Publications page unchanged ✓
- [ ] All pages visually aligned
- [ ] Responsive layouts still work
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on any page

---

## Notes

- This change only affects visual layout, not functionality
- Content remains fully responsive
- Grid layouts (people cards, featured projects, etc.) still work within the 800px container
- The narrower width actually improves the appearance of multi-column grids on very wide screens
