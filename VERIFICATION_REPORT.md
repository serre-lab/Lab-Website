## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix Xplique PDF** - Download the actual paper (currently 284 bytes)
2. **Add URLs for recent papers (2016-2022)** - These should have DOIs or conference pages

### Medium Priority
3. **Add URLs for MIT Technical Reports** - These have persistent URLs on dspace.mit.edu
4. **Verify all URLs are working** - Test that each URL actually points to the correct paper

### Low Priority
5. **Add DOIs where available** - Many journals provide DOIs that are more stable than direct URLs

---

## Notes

- Most missing URLs are for:
  - MIT-CSAIL Technical Reports (can be added via dspace.mit.edu)
  - Workshop papers (may only have PDF)
  - Encyclopedia chapters (may require institutional access)

- All 125 papers have local PDF copies (except 1 empty file)
- Recent papers (2020+) nearly all have proper URLs

## Next Steps

1. Fix the empty Xplique PDF
2. Search for Xplique PDF in backup directories (new_pdfs, oldpdfs)
3. Add URLs for MIT Technical Reports using pattern: `https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/[ID]`
4. Add URLs for recent conference/journal papers
